# Testris_NEAT

Use NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies(NEAT) to create a neural network to play the Tetris

This concept is inspried by the reference ['This Neural Network has MASTERED TETRIS']([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoR4ilCWwKA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yXBNKubb2o)) on youtube.

## How do AI play the Tetris

The decision ai making in Tetris is after-state decision, which means that ai will compare the score of every position the current block put in and choose the best one.

According to papers, the input information to neural work is prefer hand-designed feature than raw screen input. The preformance of former input would much better than the other one.

Also, many pappers recommen that the hand=designed features are :

1. the height of columns
2. the hole of columns
3. the height difference between columns
4. max height and min height

In this project, i simplify the hand-designed feature with just five input:

1. the whole holes
2. the whole height
3. the whole difference
4. the max height
5. the min height


## The skill use in this project

This project is only use python to create.

the packages use:

1.pygame
2.neat
